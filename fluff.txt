Setting: In the post-apocalyptic steam-funk future of the 70s, 1800s, and present combined, 
hair is everything. Magic used to course through every being and object in this world, but after The Fall,
Magic disappeared from everything except hair. And now, in the ruins of society, you and your posse navigate a (man)gritty criminal overworld for survival, profit, and funk.
